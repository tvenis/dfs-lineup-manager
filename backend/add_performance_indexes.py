Database Performance Index Migration
Adds critical indexes to optimize Player Pool page performance

This script adds indexes for:
1. Player Pool Entry queries (week_id + position + excluded filtering)
2. Player Prop Bets queries (week_id + playerDkId + market + bookmaker)
3. Player queries (position + team filtering)
4. Game queries (week_id + team_id for analysis)

Expected Performance Impact:
- Player Pool queries: 50-70% faster
- Props batch queries: 60-80% faster
- Analysis queries: 40-60% faster
