# Week 6 Testing Guide - OPRK Migration

## Quick Start: What Changed?

Players no longer duplicate on the Player Props page! üéâ

**The Fix**: OPRK data moved from pool-specific table to week-specific table.

---

## Testing Steps for Week 6

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Import Week 6 Player Pool (As Normal)

Import your Week 6 player pool data exactly as you normally would. The system will now automatically:
- ‚úÖ Import player pool entries (as before)
- ‚úÖ **NEW**: Extract OPRK and save to `weekly_player_summary` table

**What to Watch For:**
Check your import logs for messages like:
```
Successfully updated X weekly summary records
Extracted OPRK for player XXXXX: value=X, quality=High/Medium/Low
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to Player Props Page

Go to: `/leaderboard/player-props`

**Before the fix:** Players in both "Main Slate" and "Showdown" appeared twice
**After the fix:** Each player appears exactly once ‚ú®

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Quick Visual Check

Select Week 6 and look for:

‚úÖ **No duplicate players** - Each player name appears only once
‚úÖ **OPRK column shows values** - Numbers and colored indicators display
‚úÖ **All data intact** - Opponent, bookmaker, market, probability all correct
‚úÖ **Filters work** - Position, Tier, Market, Bookmaker filters function normally

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Test Edge Cases

#### Test Different Markets
- Anytime TD
- Passing Yards
- Receiving Yards
- 1.5+ Player TDs

**Expected**: No duplicates in any market

#### Test Position Filters
- QB
- RB
- WR
- TE

**Expected**: No duplicates for any position

#### Test Tier Filter
- Tier 1
- Tier 2
- Tier 3
- Tier 4

**Expected**: Tier filter works correctly with no duplicates

## If You See Issues

### Issue: No OPRK values showing
**Check:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM weekly_player_summary 
WHERE week_id = <YOUR_WEEK_6_ID> 
AND oprk_value IS NOT NULL;
```

If count is 0 or very low:
- Re-run the import
- Check that `draftStatAttributes` has data in `player_pool_entries`

### Issue: Still seeing duplicates
**Check:**
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Refresh the page
3. Check if backend was restarted after code changes
4. Verify you're on Week 6 (not an older week)

### Issue: Other errors
Check backend logs for errors in:
- `WeeklySummaryService.populate_weekly_summary()`
- `get_player_props_for_leaderboard()` endpoint

---

## Success Indicators

‚úÖ Import completes with "Successfully updated X weekly summary records"
‚úÖ Player Props page loads without errors
‚úÖ Each player appears exactly once
‚úÖ OPRK values display correctly
‚úÖ All filters work as expected
‚úÖ Page performance feels faster (simplified queries)

---

## Verification Commands

### Count Players with OPRK
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as players_with_oprk
FROM weekly_player_summary
WHERE week_id = <WEEK_6_ID>
AND oprk_value IS NOT NULL;
```

### View Sample OPRK Data
```sql
SELECT 
    p.displayName,
    p.position,
    wps.oprk_value,
    wps.oprk_quality
FROM weekly_player_summary wps
JOIN players p ON p.playerDkId = wps.playerDkId
WHERE wps.week_id = <WEEK_6_ID>
AND wps.oprk_value IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY wps.oprk_value
LIMIT 10;
```

### Test API Endpoint Directly
```bash
# Replace with your week_id
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/leaderboard/player-props?week=<WEEK_6_ID>&market=anytime_td"
```

Check the response for:
- No duplicate `player_id` values
- `oprk_value` and `oprk_quality` fields present

## Need Help?

All changes are documented in:
- `OPRK_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Complete technical details
- `OPRK_MIGRATION_STEP1.md` - Step-by-step implementation log
- `MIGRATION_COMMANDS.md` - Quick commands reference

The migration is **fully reversible** - original OPRK data is still in `player_pool_entries` if needed.
