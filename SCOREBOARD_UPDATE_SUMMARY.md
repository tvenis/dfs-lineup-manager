# Scoreboard Page Update Summary

## Overview
Updated the Scoreboard page to default to the **Last Completed Week** instead of the **Active Week**.

## What Changed

### Before (Active Week Default)
```typescript
// Old logic - defaulted to Active week first
const activeWeek = weeksArray.find((w: any) => w.status === 'Active');
if (activeWeek) {
  setWeekFilter(`week-${activeWeek.week_number}`);
} else if (weeksArray.length > 0) {
  // Fallback to most recent completed week
  const completedWeeks = weeksArray.filter((w: any) => w.status === 'Completed');
  if (completedWeeks.length > 0) {
    const mostRecent = completedWeeks.sort((a: any, b: any) => b.week_number - a.week_number)[0];
    setWeekFilter(`week-${mostRecent.week_number}`);
  }
}
```

### After (Last Completed Week Default)
```typescript
// New logic - defaults to Last Completed week first
const completedWeeks = weeksArray.filter((w: any) => w.status === 'Completed');
if (completedWeeks.length > 0) {
  // Sort by year and week_number descending to get the most recent completed week
  const sortedCompleted = completedWeeks.sort((a: any, b: any) => {
    if (a.year !== b.year) return b.year - a.year;
    return b.week_number - a.week_number;
  });
  const mostRecentCompleted = sortedCompleted[0];
  setWeekFilter(`week-${mostRecentCompleted.week_number}`);
} else {
  // Fallback to Active week if no completed weeks exist
  const activeWeek = weeksArray.find((w: any) => w.status === 'Active');
  if (activeWeek) {
    setWeekFilter(`week-${activeWeek.week_number}`);
  }
}
```

## Why This Makes Sense

The Scoreboard page shows **contest results and performance metrics**. These are naturally associated with completed weeks where:
- Contests have finished
- Results are final
- Points are scored
- Winnings are distributed

By defaulting to the last completed week, users immediately see their most recent finalized results when they open the scoreboard.

## Behavior

### Scenario 1: Normal Operation (Has Completed Weeks)
- ✅ Defaults to the most recent completed week
- Example: If weeks 1-9 are completed and week 10 is active, shows Week 9 by default

### Scenario 2: Beginning of Season (No Completed Weeks)
- ✅ Falls back to active week
- Example: If only week 1 is active and no weeks are completed, shows Week 1

### Scenario 3: Cross-Year Handling
- ✅ Properly handles year transitions
- Example: 2025 Week 1 (Completed) is newer than 2024 Week 18 (Completed)

## Files Modified

- `/Users/tvenis/DFS_App/web/src/app/scoreboard/page.tsx` (lines 93-111)

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   cd web
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Scoreboard page:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/scoreboard

3. **Verify default week:**
   - Check that the week filter dropdown shows the last completed week
   - Not the active week (unless no completed weeks exist)

4. **Verify fallback behavior:**
   - If testing early in a season with no completed weeks, verify it falls back to active week

### Expected Behavior

**When you open the Scoreboard:**
- Week dropdown should show the most recent completed week
- Contest results for that week should be displayed
- User can still manually change to view other weeks (Active, All Weeks, or specific weeks)

## Related Changes

This change is part of a larger effort to standardize week selection across the application:

1. ✅ Created dedicated API endpoints (`/api/weeks/active` and `/api/weeks/last-completed`)
2. ✅ Created comprehensive backend tests (14+ test cases)
3. ✅ Updated frontend `WeekService` with new methods
4. ✅ Created comprehensive frontend tests (15+ test cases)
5. ✅ **Updated Scoreboard page** (this change)

## Documentation

For more information about the week API endpoints, see:
- `/Users/tvenis/DFS_App/docs/WEEK_API_ENDPOINTS.md`

## Consistency with Other Pages

This change makes the Scoreboard page consistent with other pages that deal with completed/historical data:

| Page | Default Week | Reasoning |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **Scoreboard** | Last Completed | Shows finalized contest results |
| Import Player Actuals | Last Completed | Imports actual stats from completed games |
| Import Team Stats | Last Completed | Imports stats from completed games |
| Lineup Builder | Active | Building lineups for upcoming contests |
| Player Pool | Active | Viewing players for upcoming week |

## User Impact

**Positive:**
- ✅ More intuitive default (users want to see results, not incomplete data)
- ✅ Consistent with import pages
- ✅ Reduces clicks (most common use case is viewing last week's results)

**Minimal:**
- Users can still easily select "Active Week" from the dropdown if needed
- All filtering functionality remains the same
